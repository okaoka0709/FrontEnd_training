        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Periodical cicadas spend most of their life underground. Their habitat lies in eastern united states. 
            There are 15 geographically distinct populations, or broods of periodical cicadas. 
            Each brood appears in different time and in its own synchronizing life cycle. 
            Among these broods, 12 of them appear in every 17 years while another 3 broods appear in every 13 years. 
            This year, 2021, the biggest brood, brood X, will make its first appearance on the ground in May. 
            While the exact time is not sure, it is said that when the soil temperature reaches to 64 degrees Fahrenheit, 
            juvenile cicadas will climb out to the ground to shed its exoskeleton and unfurl its wings to become adult cicadas. 
            Their bodies are black and have iconic red eyes and orange veins in the wings. This is what it looks like. 
            In the following weeks, male cicadas will make buzzy noises as loud as possible to attract female cicadas. 
            The noises fill the air can be up to 80 to 100 decibels, which equals to the sound of a motorcycle. 
            After mating, the female cicadas will lay eggs on the branches of the trees and their tasks are done. 
            When the eggs hatch, small cicadas will fall off the trees and burrow themselves underground. 
            Another cycle starts and you have to wait for another 17 years to see billions of cicadas crawling on the trees and buzzling in the air again.</p>

        <p>Periodical cicadas appears in every 13 or 17 years. It has two advantages. 
            One is that before being mature, their predators might be dead. They can live longer than their predators.
             Another is that these two numbers are both prime numbers, it means that they are only divisible by 1 and its own. 
             Assume a predatorâ€™s lifespan is 5 years, every 65 or 85 years can periodical cicadas meet its predators again. 
             It is one magic to reduce the number of predators that periodical cicadas might encounter, which effectively increases their rate of survival. </p>
